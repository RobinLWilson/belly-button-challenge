Module 14 Challenge

This is an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/).

Users can choose a test subject's id and they will see the individual's demographic information, a bar chart of the individual's 10 largest samples with details, and a bubble chart that explores each of the samples.
